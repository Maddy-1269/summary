Summary
I have developed strong foundational skills across Linux administration, containerization, automation, networking, DevOps tools, and backend development. Below is a concise summary of the knowledge and hands-on experience I have gained:
ðŸ”¹ Operating System & Linux Administration
â€¢	Learned essential OS concepts and Linux environment usage
â€¢	Worked with key Linux commands: ls, mkdir, touch, chmod, chown, ps, ps aux, su, pwd, ping, etc.
â€¢	Created and deleted users & groups, and assigned permissions and ownership for files/directories
â€¢	Monitored processes and learned how to terminate processes when required
ðŸ”¹ Git & GitHub (Version Control & Code Collaboration)
â€¢	Learned Git as a distributed Version Control System
â€¢	Initialized and tracked a project with:
o	git init
o	git add .
o	git commit -m "message"
â€¢	Created and managed branches: git branch, git branch -m main
â€¢	Connected local repo to GitHub remote and pushed code:
o	git remote add origin <repo-url>
o	git push -u origin main
â€¢	Understood version history and collaborative workflows through GitHub
ðŸ”¹ Python Programming (Basics)
â€¢	Covered data types, variables, operators, keywords
â€¢	Used conditional statements (if/else), loops (for, while)
â€¢	Wrote small automation scripts and backend logic
ðŸ”¹ PostgreSQL Database
â€¢	Installed PostgreSQL and created a database with username/password authentication
â€¢	Created tables, inserted and retrieved rows using SQL queries
ðŸ”¹ Docker & Containers
â€¢	Wrote Dockerfiles for a Python application
â€¢	Built Docker images and ran containers successfully
ðŸ”¹ Docker Compose
â€¢	Created Docker Compose setup to manage multiple microservices together
â€¢	Automated container orchestration and networking within services
ðŸ”¹ Shell Scripting (Bash)
â€¢	Automated system monitoring tasks (date/time, uptime, CPU load, memory & disk usage)
â€¢	Created automation scripts for generating multiple files and directories at once
ðŸ”¹ Networking Protocols & Mail Delivery Tools
â€¢	Understood how communication happens between systems over networks
â€¢	Tools learned:
o	dovecot, postfix, mailutils â†’ email sending/receiving
o	telnet, openssl â†’ low-level protocol testing & secure communication testing
o	tcpdump â†’ network packet monitoring/traffic inspection
ðŸ”¹ RabbitMQ + Celery + Ngrok Integration
â€¢	Built an email notification workflow:
o	Backend: Python application
o	Messaging Queue: RabbitMQ
o	Task Manager: Celery
o	Exposure to Internet: Ngrok tunnel
o	Reverse proxy: Nginx
â€¢	Configured .env credentials for automated message sending
â€¢	When the app runs â†’ RabbitMQ & Celery trigger an automated email send process
ðŸ”¹ Jenkins â€“ Continuous Integration (CI)
â€¢	Installed Jenkins with required plugins (Git, Java, Python, SSL/TLS tools)
â€¢	Created automated CI pipelines with GitHub Webhooks
o	On every code push â†’ Jenkins automatically triggers a build
â€¢	Managed Jenkins users and assigned appropriate roles/permissions
ðŸ”¹ DevOps Utility â€“ Fetch
â€¢	Used Fetch to create quick access shortcuts for servers, containers, and file listings on Ubuntu
